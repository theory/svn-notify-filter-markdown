SVN/Notify/Filter/Markdown version 0.03
=======================================

This module filters SVN::Notify log message output from Markdown format into
HTML. Essentially, this means that if you write your commit log messages using
Markdown and like to use L<SVN::Notify::HTML|SVN::Notify::HTML> or
L<SVN::Notify::HTML::ColorDiff|SVN::Notify::HTML::ColorDiff> to format your
commit notifications, you can use this filter to convert the Markdown in the
log message to HTML.

Or, if you don't have Module::Build installed, type the following:
