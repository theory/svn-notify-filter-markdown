Revision history for Perl extension SVN::Notify::Filter::Markdown.

0.04
      - Added Test::Pod to the `recommends` parameter in `Build.PL`.

0.03  2008-05-18T03:41:38
      - Removed the spelling test from the distribution, since it can
        fail on systems without a spell program or using a different locale.

0.02  2008-05-15T03:24:13
      - Updated copyright.
      - Added Test::More to the "build_requires" parameter in Build.PL.
      - Added spelling test. No spelling errors found.
      - Now requiring HTML::Entities, since SVN::Notify only recommends it,
        but this module only does HTML.
      - Fixed a test failure when for systems without sendmail. Now
        SVN::Notify won't even look.        

0.01  2008-04-02T05:11:13
      - Initial public release.
