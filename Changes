      - Updated copyright.
      - Added Test::More to the "build_requires" parameter in Build.PL.
      - Added spelling test. No spelling errors found.
      - Now requiring HTML::Entities, since SVN::Notify only recommends it,
        but this module only does HTML.
      - Fixed a test failure when for systems without sendmail. Now
        SVN::Notify won't even look.
